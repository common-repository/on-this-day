== Description ==

This plugin was inspired by "On this day" in [Wikipedia's home page](http://en.wikipedia.org/). It can list posts which have same calendar date as today or as specific post.

It can automatically append "On This Day" list after post content. You can use it as Widget, or just call `OTDList()` where you need to show OTD list.
